# ACC 2026 Workshop: Data Driven Methods for Space Resiliency

Abstract
This workshop will showcase the cutting edge of research and practice in data driven methods for the sustainable utilization of the space domain. Today, space is intricately woven into the fabric of our terrestrial existence. Assets in orbit support nearly every aspect of human life, be it agriculture, finance, communication, navigation, economic
development, national security, or our many scientific endeavors. During the past decade, increased multinational and commercial activity, combined with weak governance has led to an inordinate rise in active and passive threats to the resiliency of space systems. The proposed workshop will showcase the cutting edge of research and practice in
both predictive and forensic analytical capabilities that can convert data into certifiably accurate models for decision and control in orbit. Speakers will span the government, national labs, and academia, presenting challenges, opportunities, and solutions for this multifaceted domain. The following list provides broad areas of interest for technical content to be presented in the proposed workshop:

<ul>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ul>

• Sustainable utilization of the space domain
• Autonomous decision making under duress
• Learning orbital mechanics from sparse and/or unreliable data
• Communication and coordination
• Estimation and control at the frontier: VLEO to Cislunar
• Computer vision, machine learning and AI in space
• Advances in sensing and data fusion
• Impact of space assets on life on Earth
